## 🚀 About Me

I'm a young IT professional passionate about DevOps, Linux, and building smart, automated systems. Currently working towards financial independence, my long-term goal is to create a modern, self-sufficient home in the Norwegian wilderness – blending traditional style with cutting-edge technology.

I believe in clean architecture, efficient workflows, and clear, professional communication. I strive to bridge the gap between analytical precision and human-centered motivation – in code, in life, and in the work I do.
